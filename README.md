# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using Machine Learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was built as part of my Machine Learning learning journey.  
I initially followed a YouTube tutorial for guidance, but I focused on understanding each step of the machine learning pipeline and concepts involved.

The goal of this project is to understand how real-world datasets are processed and how machine learning models are trained and evaluated.
